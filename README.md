## Why I Built This

As an aspiring electrical engineering major, I wanted a summer project that would let me integrate core EE principles — real-time signal control, sensor input processing, and actuator response — into a fun, hands-on system. I chose to build a voice-controlled target shooter robot because it challenged me to connect hardware and software in a way that simulates real-world embedded systems, like those used in robotics and automation.

This project allowed me to explore:
- GPIO-level control of motors and servos
- Signal conditioning and power management
- Python-based voice input processing
- CAD modeling for mounting components

It was also an opportunity to explore system design and iterate through the engineering process from concept to demo. I documented everything through GitHub and videos to share not just what I built, but how I thought through each challenge.
